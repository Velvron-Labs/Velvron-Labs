# 🚀 Velvron Labs Redesign - TODO

## 🎯 Project Vision
Transform the current template-y startup page into a **hardcore, professional tech showcase** that screams "serious innovators" for funding purposes. No more generic glassmorphism - we're going enterprise-grade sophisticated.

## 🔥 Key Features to Implement

### Hero Section
- [ ] **3D Geometric Logo**: Rotating dodecahedron/icosahedron that morphs on scroll
- [ ] **Kinetic Typography**: Text that builds itself as user scrolls
- [ ] **GSAP Timeline Sequences**: Smooth reveal animations
- [ ] **Three.js Shader Materials**: High-tech visual effects
- [ ] **Interactive Elements**: Logo responds to mouse movement

### Scroll-Driven Storytelling
- [ ] **Discrete Section Transitions**: Smooth GSAP-powered section changes
- [ ] **Scroll-Triggered Morphing Geometries**: Shapes transform between sections
- [ ] **Progressive Content Reveal**: Information unveils as user scrolls
- [ ] **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between "chapters"

### Interactive Terminal Elements
- [ ] **Terminal-Style Code Blocks**: Steel gray terminal aesthetic
- [ ] **Typing Animations**: Code appears to be typed in real-time
- [ ] **Interactive Demos**: Clickable terminal windows
- [ ] **Syntax Highlighting**: Professional code presentation

### Three.js Integration
- [ ] **Floating Geometric Shapes**: Subtle 3D accents throughout
- [ ] **Scroll-Responsive 3D**: Elements react to scroll position
